        review: "Thanks, Jo- it's a pity we left early and thank you for helping us with cancellations. We loved NZ and New Zealanders and will come back. Loved the Distinction chain of hotels and we missed it at Te Anau where we had to stay at another hotel (which was lovely, but not as swish) It worked out fine without breakfast included in our hotel rates as it was easy to find great cafes for the early risers while the others just dined ala carte in the hotel. Great cafes around the Distinction hotels. The drive from Dunedin to Te Anau was long and we couldn't go via Invercargill and get to Te Anau in time for the glow worm tour. It was fine, and if we had more time, would add an extra day in Invercargill as the short drive in and out of The Catlins was very scenic. A highlight of our short trip was Fleur's Cafe in Moeraki- such a surprise to find such fresh cooking and seafood. Wishing you all the best- be safe and healthy",

        review: 'This was an amazing tour with lots of beautiful sites and activities. Everything was great and went smoothly for the entire trip until it was time to come home. This is when things went horribly wrong with 9 airline delays, re-routes, cancellations and rebooking on another airline due to countries closing down borders for the CoVid-19 virus outbreak but we made it home with hours to spare before New Zealand closed its borders. A big thank you to all for the trip and a thank you to all New Zealanders for being gracious and accommodating.',

        review: 'Chelsea Lodge arranged a 9-day tour for us that met all of our requests. We started in Christchurch, spent a day there, took the scenic TranzAlpine train to Moana and back, went by train to Kaikoura, then by train and ferry to Wellington where we also spent a day before taking a train to Auckland, spent a day there, and then flew back to Los Angeles. She arranged lodgings for us each night with breakfasts included and contracted for transportation to and from airports and train or ferry stations to and from our lodgings. She contracted for hop-on-hop-off tours at Christchurch, Wellington, and Waiheke Island near Auckland plus a visit to the Antarctic museum at Christchurch Airport and a three-course dinner at the Sky Tower Restaurant in Auckland--all paid for in a surprisingly low itinerary charge. This allowed us to see both the north and south islands and much beautiful scenery as well as to meet many friendly and helpful New Zealanders. We really appreciated her attention to detail and her expert knowledge of New Zealand and would recommend her to anyone wanting an individualized trip in this lovely island country.',

        review: "Your itinerary gave us a beautiful experience of NZ's expansive geography and peoples. We appreciated the selection of accommodation (with a couple of exceptions) which met our requests. The cars were suitable. All reservations were smooth and welcoming. Excursions were also efficient, friendly and satisfying with the exception of the Middle Earth tour. The development of the Covid-19 crisis and its anxieties reduced our tour minimally. The responses to our requests for help and changes by Christina and Jamie-Lee were exceptional. We are grateful for the overall tour and experience made possible by your company.",
