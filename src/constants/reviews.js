        review: "Thanks, Jo- it's a pity we left early and thank you for helping us with cancellations. We loved NZ and New Zealanders and will come back. It was fine, and if we had more time, would add an extra day in Invercargill as the short drive in and out of The Catlins was very scenic. A highlight of our short trip was Fleur's Cafe in Moeraki- such a surprise to find such fresh cooking and seafood. Wishing you all the best- be safe and healthy",

        review: 'This was an amazing tour with lots of beautiful sites and activities. Everything was great and went smoothly for the entire trip until it was time to come home. This is when things went horribly wrong with 9 airline delays, re-routes, cancellations and rebooking on another airline due to countries closing down borders for the CoVid-19 virus outbreak but we made it home with hours to spare before New Zealand closed its borders. A big thank you to all for the trip and a thank you to all New Zealanders for being gracious and accommodating.',

        review: "Your itinerary gave us a beautiful experience of NZ's expansive geography and peoples. We appreciated the selection of accommodation (with a couple of exceptions) which met our requests. The cars were suitable. All reservations were smooth and welcoming. Excursions were also efficient, friendly and satisfying with the exception of the Middle Earth tour. The development of the Covid-19 crisis and its anxieties reduced our tour minimally. The responses to our requests for help and changes by Christina and Jamie-Lee were exceptional. We are grateful for the overall tour and experience made possible by your company.",
